## Problem
#### This contains:
> 31 Next Permutation
46 Permutations
47 Permutations II
60 Permutation Sequence

<!-- more -->

#### 31. Next Permutation
>Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.
>
If such arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (ie, sorted in ascending order).
>
The replacement must be in-place, do not allocate extra memory.
>
Here are some examples. Inputs are in the left-hand column and its corresponding outputs are in the right-hand column.
>
1,2,3 → 1,3,2
3,2,1 → 1,2,3
1,1,5 → 1,5,1
