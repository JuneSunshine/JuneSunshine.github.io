## Philosophy
> In recreational mathematics, a magic square is a n times n square grid where n is the number of cells on each side filled with distinct positive integers in the range 1,2,...,n^2 such that each cell contains a different integer and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal. 
The sum is called the magic constant or magic sum of the magic square. A square grid with n cells on each side is said to have order n.
