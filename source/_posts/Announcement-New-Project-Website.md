## A New Website Built

[lijingyang.me](https://lijingyang.me/index.html) was recently built for project showcase of CSCI 731 class. 

It is planned to be used for showing all the projects I have done so far in the future, but currently there is only one project on the website.

I will also post my bio and social links on it. You can contact me in any ways you like if you are interested at my works.
